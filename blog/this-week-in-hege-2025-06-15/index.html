        <h1>This Week in $HEGE</h1>
        <p>
          Markets have been on a roller-coaster, but Hege steadily keeps building. This week, $HEGE trading went live on BiFinance, Reddit competition winners were selected, and a new competition was announced.

<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of This Week in $HEGE. As usual there is
lots to cover, so let’s get to it!</p>

<h2 id="market-update">Market update</h2>
<p>First off, let’s start with a short market update. Some roller-coaster week we
had, huh? Kicking off the week with strong momentum, it surely looked like 10M
was in reach. Then, as I’m sure you’re all painfully aware, geopolitics threw a
bucket of sand in our gears and the party was promptly ruined. As if we didn’t
have enough fear and uncertainty in the market already!</p>
<p>It’s still too early to tell what the fallout of this rekindled conflict between
Israel and Iran will be. Will it escalate? Will it spread to other parts of the
Middle East? Or will cooler heads ultimately prevail? The only correct answer
right now is this: we don’t know yet. As an investor in these situations, we’d
suggest to ignore all the narratives and just look at the charts. That might
sound like a strange idea. But think about it: The market represents the
collective intelligence of all participants all across the world. Looking at the
charts cuts through all the narratives and shows not what people say they do,
but what people are actually putting their money on.</p>
<p>So what do the charts say so far? Well. While the entire crypto market followed
the tradfi markets down, key support levels are still in fact holding. Bitcoin
is above its support at $101.5k, Solana is above $143, and we are still above
our main support zone around $6M market cap. From a technical perspective, until
it breaks, support is support. And so far, it’s holding. This situation might
change of course, so we must keep watching. But for now, there is no reason to
panic.</p>
<p>Looking to the crypto fundamentals outside of geopolitics, nothing has changed —
they have never been better. Institutional money keeps flowing in to the ETFs.
Companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy continue to buy. Stablecoin regulation
is coming.</p>
<p>So to sum it all up: If this conflict escalates and spreads, there could be more
pain ahead. If not, this could turn into a small blip in a bull market that will
continue over the coming months. For now the charts are holding up. We’ll keep
watching them for clues, while not letting this distract us from building and
pushing on.</p>
<h2 id="photos-from-vegas">Photos from Vegas</h2>
<p>After too long a wait, we finally got the photos from our marketing event in Las
Vegas. Sadly they weren’t great, so next time we’ll make sure to have our own
photographer there. Lesson learnt. Luckily, we can see from QR scans that the
campaign went down well, which is what matters in the end. And we did get a
decent shot of the truck with the Hege billboard. It really stands out, doesn’t
it?!</p>
